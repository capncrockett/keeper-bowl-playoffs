# Keeper Bowl Playoffs

Playoff visualization and bracket UI for a Sleeper keeper league.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- DaisyUI
- ESLint + Prettier (soon)

## Testing

- Unit/integration: `cd frontend && npm test` (Jest + RTL, jsdom). See `TESTING.md` for roadmap.
- E2E smoke: `cd frontend && npm run test:e2e` (Playwright). Configure base URL via `E2E_BASE_URL` in `.env` (root uses the deployed Vercel URL by default).

## Getting Started

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Playoff seeding

- Playoffs begin Week 15 and conclude in Week 17.
- Six-team championship bracket; seeds 1 and 2 earn first-round byes.
- Seeds 1-3: Division winners, ordered by record (wins/losses/ties) > Points For.
- Seeds 4-5: Next two best records regardless of division > Points For.
- Seed 6: Highest Points For among teams not already seeded (ignores record/division).
